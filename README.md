# Extensions for react-datasheet

A collection of composable custom renderers for
[react-datasheet](https://github.com/nadbm/react-datasheet).

## Why extensions?

[react-datasheet](https://github.com/nadbm/react-datasheet) provides a strong core of data grid functionality for react
without being too opinionated about how you use it. This allows for great flexibility, but it also means that some use
cases are not covered in the core project.

Fortunately, `react-datasheet` can be easily extended to support different behaviors through it's use of 
[render props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) throughout the core library.
